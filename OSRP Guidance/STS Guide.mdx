# How to host an STS

### Approval
- You can only host an STS with permission from the Highest Rank online, as long as it is under these reasons:

- Server is too hectic to the point the RP is being affected.

- Too many mod calls.

- An STS has not been hosted in at least 1-2 hours.

### Roles
Once permission is given, collect all staff members into the Online Staff VC, and assign the following roles:

- At least 1 Supervisor+ to Supervise the STS

- At least 1 person for Crowd Control

- At least 1 On-Duty Staff Member (optional if not applicable due to amount of staff online)

- A Co-Host

### Preparation
After this, prepare the Fire Department for the STS, and ensure it follows these regulations:

- At least 2 Staff Cars must block the road between the Fire Department, and the City Park Entrance, on the sides.

- At least 3 Barriers must be placed on the Forward-facing side of both staff vehicles, with equal spacing.

- Ensure all Staff are in the correct formation.

VOCALLY, NOT THROUGH :M OR :H MESSAGES.

Hello everyone, and welcome to Oklahoma State Roleplay.

We, the Staff Team, have decided to host this STS to ensure all people in the in-game server know our server rules and to maintain orderly roleplay.

Please do not emote, take out any tools, move, or talk during this STS, to ensure we have your full, undivided attention, or you may be subject to a kick from the server.

We will now begin with our In-Game Server Rules which you can find at anytime in our In-Game rules channel.

Rule 1.1: Whitelisted
Our server is semi-whitelisted, meaning you don’t have to apply to play on the server as a Civilian, however, you have to apply to play on one of our WL Departments.
Oklahoma City Police Department
Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office
OG&E (DOT)
Oklahoma State Capitol (Government)

Rule 2.2. New Life Rule (Kickable/Bannable Offense)
We heavily enforce NLR, meaning if you die in-game, you must NOT continue to RP as that character, and you must go into our Sonoran CAD, delete your dead character, and create a new one from scratch.
Not doing this can result in kicks or temporary bans until you do.

Rule 2.3: Fear Roleplay (Warnable Offence)
Fear Roleplay means to fear for your life if a gun is being pointed at you or someone nearby.

Rule 2.4: Priorities (Warnable to Bannable Offense)
You must not start a priority unless a Moderator+ has approved it.
Priorities are but not limited to:
ATM Robbery
Bank Robbery
Kidnapping
(Reminder, the definition of a priority is at the staff members discretion, if you feel the need for permission was unfair for your RP, please open a support ticket.)

Rule 2.5: Bulletproof Vehicles
All city council vehicles, and tires are bulletproof, if a City Council member is inside while in an ambush, they are allowed to call authorities from inside the vehicle, think of The Beast for the President for example.

Rule 2.6: Staff RP
Staff members are not in RP, they are also not the law. Please do not attempt to cop bait a Staff Member, they will not react.
If you see a staff member roleplaying, record/screenshot proof, and open a support ticket.

Rule 2.7: Fail Roleplay (Kickable Offense)
You must roleplay realistically, failure to do so can result in anything from a warn to a ban to maintain immersion.

Rule 2.8: Metagaming (Warnable Offense)
Metagaming is strictly forbidden, meaning of Metagaming is as follows:
To abuse a game glitch to get an advantage over other players.

Rule 2.8.5: Glitches (Bannable Offense)
In accordance with PRC ToS, we ban anyone on sight that abuses glitches in game. If you witness this, open a support ticket with proof.

Rule 2.9: Random Deathmatch

Other unrealistic features.
This is non-negotiable.

Rule 2.12: Vehicle Restrictions
Exotic Vehicles are reserved for boosters, and VIP members only.

Rule 2.13: Realism in RP
All RP must be realistic, for example, you cannot have a character with abilities a normal person would not possess, this is counted as FRP and will be treated as such.

Rule 2.14: No Intention to Roleplay (NITRP)
When joining our server you must have an intention to RP in some capacity, failure to do so may result in a permanent removal from our community.

Rule 2.15: ‘Leaving to Avoid’ Offences
LTA offences are as follows:
LTAP - Leaving to Avoid Punishment (Bannable)
LTAA - Leaving to Avoid Arrest (Bannable)
LTARP - Leaving to Avoid RP (Bannable)

Rule 1.17: Fire Alarm Trolling (Kickable Offense)
You may not trigger any fire alarms outside of a roleplay which has been given permission by staff to conduct. The fire alarms can be disruptive to other peoples roleplay.

We will now be conducting VC Checks, if you are kicked you were detected as not being in VC.

# VC Checks
