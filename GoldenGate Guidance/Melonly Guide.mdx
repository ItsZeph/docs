### Moderation Panel
Melonly provides a Web-Based Moderation Panel for easy moderation and shift management, this guide will be based upon that panel. You may access it [here](https://melonly.xyz/dashboard).

Once selecting 'Golden Gate Roleplay' on the Melonly Dashboard, you will be met with a page depicted below:

### Issuing a Moderation
When entering the panel, in the middle of the page you will find 'Create new log', you will use this to issue a moderation. When you are in a Mod Scene and you intent to moderate a user, you must fill out all fields of the moderation form. This includes, the Username of the User, Punishment you intend to issue, reason for said punishment, and a Description, Melonly will consider the description as optional, however you **MUST** place a description on every moderation.

### Starting your Shift
Upon entering the panel, you will see on the left side of the page, your Shift Management Panel, this is where you will start and end your breaks/shifts. Starting your shift is simple, just click the 'Start Shift' button, then select a Shift Type. (Reminder: To use 50/50, you must have the `50/50 Perms` role in our Discord Server)

## ER:LC API Usage
On the panel, you will see a 'ER:LC Toolbox' section, here you will find most notably the `ER:LC Member Check`, you will use this to determine whether users are in our Discord Server and in VC or not. If they show as 'Not in Discord', you should teleport to the user, and ask them if they are in the Discord, if they are not, you must walk them through entering the Discord Server. If they refuse to join, log and issue a kick.

In this area, you will also find all manner of logs that you will need, including full usernames.

## If you have any further inquiries regarding the Melonly System, open a Staff Support Ticket.
