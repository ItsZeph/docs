### Moderation Panel
ERM provides a Web-Based Moderation Panel for easy moderation and shift management, this guide will be based upon that panel. You may access it [here](https://ermbot.xyz/guilds).

Once selecting 'Maple Ontario Roleplay' on the ERM Dashboard, you will be met with a page depicted below:

### Issuing a Moderation
When entering the panel, on the top left area you will see 'Create Moderation', you will use this to issue a moderation. When you are in a Mod Scene and you intent to moderate a user, you must fill out all fields of the moderation form. This includes, the Username of the User, Punishment you intend to issue, reason for said punishment. For bans you MUST attach image or video proof, for example, a Mass RDM ban will require proof of kill logs.

### Starting your Shift
Upon entering the panel, you will see on the bottom of the page, your Shift Management panel, this is where you will start and end your breaks/shifts. Starting your shift is simple, just select a Shift Type, and start your shift via the Start Shift button. (You cannot use the Default shift type.)

## ER:LC API Usage
On the panel, you will see a 'Server Logs' section, this is where you can see the players in-game, their vehicles, and overall logs. By clicking checks you can conduct Member and Vehicle Checks.

In this area, you will also find all manner of logs that you will need, including full usernames.

## If you have any further inquiries regarding the ERM System, open a Staff Support Ticket.
