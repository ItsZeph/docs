# How to host an STS

### Approval
- You can only host an STS with permission from the Highest Rank online, as long as it is under these reasons:

- Server is too hectic to the point the RP is being affected.

- Too many mod calls.

- An STS has not been hosted in at least 1-2 hours.

### Roles
Once permission is given, collect all staff members into the Online Staff VC, and assign the following roles:

- At least 1 Supervisor+ to Supervise the STS

- At least 1 person for Crowd Control

- At least 1 On-Duty Staff Member (optional if not applicable due to amount of staff online)

- A Co-Host

### Preparation
After this, prepare the Fire Department for the STS, and ensure it follows these regulations:

- At least 2 Staff Cars must block the road between the Fire Department, and the City Park Entrance, on the sides.

- At least 3 Barriers must be placed on the Forward-facing side of both staff vehicles, with equal spacing.

- Ensure all Staff are in the correct formation.

# Formation

Hello everyone, and welcome to Oklahoma State Roleplay.

We, the Staff Team, have decided to host this STS to ensure all people in the in-game server know our server rules and to maintain orderly roleplay.

Please do not emote, take out any tools, move, or talk during this STS, to ensure we have your full, undivided attention, or you may be subject to a kick from the server.

We will now begin with our In-Game Server Rules which you can find at anytime in our In-Game rules channel.

Here at Oklahoma State Roleplay we dedicate to a realistic atmosphere, to maintain this, we have the following Realism Based Guidelines.

If you are in a scene with a gun to your head, you must roleplay as fearing for your life, failure to do this will result in moderation for Fear Roleplay.

You must roleplay all crashes that are exceeding 30 MPH.

You must not metagame, this is where you use information gained outside of roleplay to your advantage inside of roleplay.

At OSRP, RDM and VDM is strictly prohibited.

When an EMS or LEO is sounding their lights and sirens, you must then yield to them.

'Roleplay Motions' must be maintained at all times, this includes but is not limited to Search Motions, and Cuff Motions. Gun Motion is no longer required for handguns, but is required for heavy weapons such as the AK-47.

You must not interrupt, or involve yourself in an RP Scene that does not concern you.

At Oklahoma State Roleplay, you must have a realistic avatar.

New Life Rule is required to be maintained, meaning when you die, you must start a new life from fresh, with no knowledge of your previous characters death.

Unless visible, vests are not an excuse to violate NLR. If a vest is visible, you may use that vest once to protect yourself from death unless a shot is fatal.

All members are expected to be in a Discord Roleplay VC at all times to avoid flagging from our VC Checking system.

Common Sense must be used in our community. If a rule is not listed here, but is a common rule in other communities, then you may still be moderated for it.

Our banned vehicles, and guns can be found in the In-Game Rules channel.

We will now be conducting VC Checks, if you are kicked, you were flagged by our system.

# VC Checks

To conduct a VC check, go to the Melonly Dashboard, then to 'ER:LC Toolbox' then ER:LC Member Check. Kick anyone who is not in VC.
