<Note>All assets within Chief Rich's Oklahoma State RP, may not be used outside of the server.</Note>

# Asset Submission Policies
The policies for when you make assets for anything within OSRP.

### 1. Ownership
When you make and submit assets for use either within the in-game server via liveries, or department documentation etc. You waive the ownership to those assets, and waive the right to remove them if you no longer represent the department or are terminated. Deletion of these assets via other third-party means will be considered as raiding.

### 2. Credit
When you make or submit assets, you are not entitled to credit for that asset, large scale assets such as **Vehicle Liveries** and **Comprehensive Department Documents** will receive full credit, smaller assets will only be added to the server with no credit.

### 3. Retraction
At no point in time may you 'retract' your assets from the server. Referring back to Rule 1, all assets made are for the ownership of OSRP. If you wish to leave the server, you are entitled to, but the assets will remain.

<Warning>Any violations of the above rules may result in a blacklist from the community</Warning>
