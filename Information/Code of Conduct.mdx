### 9. Status [ONLY APPLIES TO IA+]
Unless you are away from your Device, you are not permitted to place yourself on 'Do Not Disturb' on Discord, this is so you are reachable at all times. In addition, unless you are away for an extended period of time, you cannot go 'Invisible', failure to abide by this can be treated as 'Avoiding Directorial Board' which is a high-level offense.

### 10. Asking for SSUs.
Asking for SSU's is prohibited. Any sight of this will be considered as 'begging' which will result in a strike on sight.

### 11. SSU Polls
If a Staff Poll is sent out, there will be two reactions placed on it, a tick, and an cross. You are expected to react to one of them, tick if you are available, cross if you are unavailable. This a requirement for all Staff Members. Additionally, **if you react, you cannot unreact, this will result in a termination.**

### 12. Interrupting Directorial Board
When in VC, Directorial Board holds priority when speaking, and must not be interrupted whilst speaking. Any sight of this is a server-mute instantly.

# Recording/Picture Shoot Expectations
<Info>The GoldenGate Directorial Board hosts recordings/shoots for various promotional videos/pictures overtime, these rules help us streamline our recordings to make them more effective and professional.</Info>

### 1. Authority
The Directorial Board holds control over the recording or shoot, meaning anything you are asked to do/go to, you must act upon that without arguing in a timely manner.

### 2. PTS
Recordings and shoots must stay organized at all times, to uphold this we enforce a PTS (Permission to Speak) system. This requires you to say 'PTS' and wait for a approval from an Directorial Board Member before allowing you to speak.
